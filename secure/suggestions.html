          Although this was a learning project involving Oauth 2.0,
          some general security tips were identified. This page
          is intended to be an example to show a few security suggestions.
          These are not part of Oauth, but you may find them interesting.
          There is more information in the help documentation for the
          collab_auth repository for this project.

      <h3 class="h3-style">User Input</h3>
      <div class="description-contents">
        <p>
          It is a good practice to sanitize user input.
          This can reduce the risk that embedded command characters could
          insert script tags or SQL commands as input to a database.
          In this example, the backend API server uses express-validator to
          implement a character filter to sanitize user input.
          In the example below, this can be demonstrated by attempting to submit a string including
          symbols like ; $ { } &lt; &gt;. Input data validation should identify
          these characters as unsafe and reject the request with 422 status.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally or alternately, input can be encoded to convert
          command characters to safe equivalent. However, example below uses
          only a character &quot;allow list&quot; without encoding or escaping.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3 class="h3-style">Cross-site Data Submission Mitigations</h3>
      <div class="description-contents">
        <p>
          Browser data submission can include some risk that a user's cookie for one site
          can be used to authorize cross-site data submission by another site's
          web page when loaded in the same browser.
          When running a Node/Express web server, the npm package
          <a href="https://github.com/expressjs/csurf">csurf</a>
          is one of several methods that can be used to reduce this risk.
          The frontend web server can use the csurf middleware to insert a random csrf token into a
          web page HTML file as a meta tag attribute.
          Subsequent API calls can extract the random token and include the token with an API request.
          The frontend web server will then match the random token in the API request against the
          token embedded into the HTML web page before forwarding the request to the reverse proxy.
          A new random token is created each time the HTML page is loaded of refreshed.
          The token is unique to a specific user.
          Methods GET and HEAD are exempt because they do not submit data.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is an example where a user can enter data into the web browser,
          submit to the web server, through the reverse proxy, to the backend
          database API. An existing database record referenced by id (uuid) is modified to a new value.
          Similar to the examples on the main page, the frontend web server will add
          the oauth 2.0 access_token to the request as it passes through
          the web server reverse proxy for token validation by the backend
          API before handling the request.
        </p>
        <p>
          To clarify, there are two different types of token.
          The csrf token is between web browser and web server.
          The oauth access_token is between the frontend web server and backend database server.
          In the example below, a checkbox had been added to disable the csrf token header
          in the browser in order to show that the frontend web server properly rejects the request.
          (Note: this has nothing to do with oauth tokens.)
        </p>
        <p>
          To try this: 1) Read the weather, 2) Write alternate value,
          3) Read again to see your change.

          This next example is intended to fail.
        </p>
        <p>
          Without using JavaScript, a simple &lt;form&gt; element
          with a submit button is used to make a data submission.
          In order to receive a form POST request, the API includes a custom
          route for method POST to route /v1/data/manual-data/update/.
          This is equivalent to method PATCH to route /vi/data/manual-data/.
        </p>
        <p>
          If this form were embedded in another web site's HTML page with
          proper URL, and if a user can be tricked to click the submit button,
          the use of csrf tokens would reduce risk of cross-site vulnerability.
        </p>
        <p>
          This should be blocked for several reasons:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The form submission violates Content Security Policy: form-action 'none'; </li>
          <li>The backend API has restricted input to JSON (x-www-form-urlencoded is not parsed)</li>
          <li>The request is submitted without a valid csrf token</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you want to temporarily bypass these to try each mitigation one at a time,
          in the collab-backend-api repository, file app.js, you can remove the
          comment from &quot;app.use(express.urlencoded());&quot;.
          In the collab-frontend repository, file app.js, add comment in
          front of the CSP directive &quot;formAction: [&quot'none'&quot],&quot;.
          In the collab-frontend repository, file app.js, find &quot;app.use('/api',&quot;, then, just below,
          add a comment infront of &quot;csrfProtection,&quot;.
        </p>
        <p>
          The [Write Data] button below will submit the form as shown.
          The browser development tools console should show the errors.
        </p>
<pre class="form-code">

      <h3 class="h3-style">Content Security Policy (CSP)</h3>
      <div class="description-contents">
        <p>
          Modern web browsers have default security policies that place restrictions
          on the URL locations that a web page is allowed to interact with.
          A Content Security Policy (CSP) is an optional set of policies that can be
          specified by a web server when it offers a web page for download.
          A compliant web browser would be expected to enforce these policies.
          In the case of this page, the javascript, css styles, image files,
          and API calls all connect to the same web server from which
          the main HTML file was loaded. Use of a reverse proxy with oauth access_tokens
          eliminates the need for the browser to connect to different sites.
          Therefore, overall security risk can be improved by tightening the CSP.
          There are many CSP tutorials available online.
          To view the CSP, open the web browser developer tools, open the network tab,
          refresh this page, select the main page, review the 'Response Headers'.
          The CSP for this page should look something similar to the following example:
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="info-div" >
        Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none';base-uri 'self';connect-src 'self';
        img-src 'self';script-src 'self';style-src 'self';form-action 'none';frame-ancestors 'none'
