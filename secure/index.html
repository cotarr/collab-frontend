            This git repository is the 2nd out of 4 repositories that were
            created as a learning project to learn Oauth 2.0. The diagram above shows
            the entire project with authorization server, mock web server, mock database server,
            and mock IOT device.
          </p>
          <p>
            This web page and associated web server (collab-frontend) demonstrate how
            a user can interact with the overall project.
            The diagram below shows the frontend web server at the center.
            The overall purpose of this page is to demonstrate the relationship
            between the user's cookie stored in the web browser on the left, the user's
            Oauth 2.0 access_token, stored in the frontend
            web server in the middle, and use of the token to access resources on the
            backend API server shown on the right.

              The upper left corner of the page include a menu icon that will display 
              a selection menu along the left side of the page. Each section includes a description
              of the specific demonstration for that page.

        <div class="description-contents">
          <p>
            It is a good assumption you have the mock web server (collab-frontend)
            running, or you would not see this page.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is also a good assumption that the login and logout buttons are
            working. This indicates the authorization server is working (collab-auth).
          </p>
          <p>
            Pressing the [Fetch Data] button will generate an API query request.
            The frontend web server will receive the request, validate the user's cookie,
            then retrieve an oauth 2.0 access token that was stored on the user's behalf.
            The web server will add the users access token and pass the request 
            to the backend API server.
            If the token is successfully validated, then the backend API will 
            return an array in JSON format and it will be displayed.
          </p>
          <p>
            To better observe this process, it is recommended to have 
            the browser development tools open to the network tab or console tab.
            Additionally, terminal windows should be open for each server. 
            The access log will show the Oauth2 handshakes as they occur.

              If you are the first step of the demonstration, only this web server (collab-frontend)
              and the authorization server (collab-auth) are running. In this case, pressing the
              button will generate the error &quot;Error, connect ECONNREFUSED&quot;.
              This is the expected result when the API database server is not running.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the second step of the demonstration, the backend API database server (collab-backend-api)
              will be running. However, at this stage no data will have been saved into the database.
              Pressing the button will query the database, but an empty array will be returned 
              such as &quot;[ ]&quot;. This is the expected result when the database table is empty.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the final stage of the demonstration, the mock IOT device is also running (collab-iot-device).
              At 1 minute intervals, the IOT device will periodically submit emulated data 
              to the mock database using a timer.
              The expected response is an array of JSON objects that contain emulated sensor data.
              Since this is a demonstration, the array is automatically prunded to 10 entries

          <p>
            This section is included  for demonstration purposes only.
            Normally a user would never possess an access_token, and
            therefore never have the need to validate a token.
            In the frontend web server, there is a temporary development route
            &quot;/proxy/oauth/introspect&quot that will submit the users"s
            access_token to the authorization server
            &quot;/oauth/introspect&quot; route.
            The introspect endpoint validates the token and returns various
            information about the user"s access_token that was submitted.
            It is included here to show example response content.
            The typical useful properties are: <b>active, scope, and user</b>.

        <div class="description-contents">
          <p>
            Scope is a complex and confusing part of OAuth2. 
            The handling of scope is implementation dependant and may differ for different situations.
            This intent of this section is to show that there are two levels of access control
            associated with oauth2 tokens. First the token itself must be valid, with a good 
            digital signature, non-expired timestamp, and it must not have been revoked.
            In many cases, a valid token may be sufficient to allow access.
            In the case where a deeper level of granularity is needed, a scheme of 
            scope values can be implemented.
          </p>
          <p>
            Consider the case where a user attempts to perform a query and request data from the database.
            The request may be allowed or denied based on a specific user and a specific route and method.
            For example, one user may be allowed to read a table, but denied write access.
            Another user may be allowed both read and write access.
            The oauth2 scope is used to allow or deny the database query.
          </p>
          <p>
            It should be noted that this request is performed using the exact same access token that worked 
            successfully in the Try The API example above.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this demonstration, a route and method have been setup on the backend database server
            such that our user Bob will not have sufficient scope to perform the request.
            The expected response is status 403 Forbidden.

            An oauth2 access token is created during the user login process. 
            The access token is stored inside the web server on the user's behalf.
            Step by step as follows:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>User logs in.</li>
            <li>A new cookie is created with unique ID. The cookie is digitally signed and returned to the user's browser.</li>
            <li>The web server stores the cookie ID in the web server session database. This creates a place to store tokens.</li>
            <li>An oauth2 client account (used by a specific web server) contains a list of allowed scopes.</li>
            <li>An oauth user account contains a list of roles.</li>
            <li>A web server access token request will include a third list of scope values that would be relevant to the web server for a specific purpose.</li>
            <li>The three scope lists, client allowed scope, the users role, and the token request scopes are intersected to create the final token scope list.</li>
            <li>A new access token ID is generated. The list of token scopes is stored in the token database for that ID, along with user's username and user ID.</li>
            <li>The token ID is encoded into new access token's payload. The token is digitally signed.</li>
            <li>The signed access token stored in the web server on behalf of the user. The end user does not have access to view or download the token.</li>
            <li>The user login is complete. The web browser has a cookie. The web server has the user's access token.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>

            Step by step of the data request.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Browser: The user's web browser has a valid cookie for this URL.</li>

            <li>Web Server: The access token from the user's session is appended to the HTTP request.</li>

            <li>Authorization Server: The token's meta-data is returned to the API database server in the introspect response.
            <li>API database Server: Each route and method has it's own list of allowed scope values. The token's meta-data scope list is compared to this specific route and method</li>

            One of the benefits of Oauth2 is separation of the user login credentials 
            from the basic operation of a web page. For a user on this page,
            this creates a problem when they want to change their password, 
            because the password is stored externally in the Oauth2 authorization server.
            To address this, the web server will accept a <b>/changepassword</b> route 
            which will return a 302 redirect to the change password URL on the 
            authorization server (collab-auth).
